TCGA Pan-Cancer Prognostic Analysis
miR-21 and SH3GLB1

Objective:
Pan-cancer evaluation of miR-21 and SH3GLB1 expression and their prognostic impact across selected TCGA tumor types with available tumor and normal samples.

Analyses
1. Tumor vs Normal expression comparison
2. Spearman correlation (tumor only)
3. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
4. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling (adjusted for age and stage)
5. Pan-cancer integration of hazard ratios
